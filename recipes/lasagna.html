    <h3>Ingredients & substitutions</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>
            Eggs: Beaten eggs are mixed with the ricotta to allow it to set,
            so that it doesnâ€™t ooze out when you cut into the lasagna.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheese: Use ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella to make this tomato lasagna.
            The ricotta adds a great creamy texture, the parmesan gives a stronger
            and sharper cheese flavor and the mozzarella creates those perfect cheese pulls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Seasoning/Aromatics: Fresh basil, fresh garlic salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spinach: This adds vegetables to the tomato lasagna to bulk it up for the meatless option.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lemon: The lemon juice and lemon zest add a burst of fresh flavor,
            and the acid helps to cut through the creamy ricotta.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tomatoes: Heirloom tomatoes are perfect for the lasagna as they are so much more flavorful than regular.
            In a pinch, large beefsteak tomatoes, or vine-ripened will work well.
            slice them and layer them with the other ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lasagna: Use no-boil lasagna sheets for this recipe.
            The moisture in the rest of the dish will cook the sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tomato sauce: Use plain tomato sauce for that authentic lasagna flavor
            or make your own marinara from scratch.
        </li>
    </ul>
